          E-Waste in India
        </h1>
        
        <p>
          How do most of us dispose of a mobile phone or a television set? Usually, by selling it to a scrap dealer. But as per the E-Waste Management Rules, which were notified in October 2016, manufacturers of electric and electronic equipments must facilitate their collection and return it to authorised dismantlers or recyclers. However, even 3 years after the law was passed, there is little evidence that it is being implemented.<br><br>
          "According to recent studies, almost 2.7 million tons of electronic waste are being generated annually in India. That's a huge quantity of waste for a country like India," explained Priti Mahesh, a senior program coordinator for Toxics Link.<br><br>

          CMOS BATTERY

        <h3>
          Also known as the non-volatile RAM, the CMOS is a battery-powered semiconductor that stores information in your computer. Its battery is typically a coin cell alkaline battery and is one of the most toxic and dangerous elements in your computer when it comes to recycling.

        <h3>
          The nervous system of your computer is usually a multi-layered board that relies heavily on metals such as copper, silver, and gold. The vast majority of printed circuit boards and cards use a lead-based solder to keep everything together.

          HARD DRIVE
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Traditionally a hard drive stores your data on a rigid magnetic disk which is sealed in an aluminum housing with its own small circuit board. New solid-state drives are small and have no moving parts, so they have some metals but must be specially shredded to destroy the data they contain.

        <h3>
          Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic is the most common element in today’s towers and cases, with a good frame and mix of ferrous steel to reinforce the shape. Because the plastic contains Brominated Flame Retardants, it must be processed.
