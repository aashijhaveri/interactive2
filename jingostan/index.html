    <h1>Jingostan</h1>

    <p>One of the world’s most ancient religions is a force in modern Indian politics. <strong>Hinduism</strong>, the avowed faith of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, forms the philosophical bedrock of his ruling <strong>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</strong>. It is also the religion of 80 percent of India’s nearly <strong>1.3 billion people</strong>, making it <strong>the third-largest faith</strong> tradition globally, after Christianity and Islam. Of course, despite its overwhelming demographic presence, <strong>Hinduism never became India’s official religion</strong>. Instead, India, as outlined in its constitution, has remained an officially <strong>secular nation</strong>, home to a dizzying array of philosophies and interpretations, movements and sects, and significant communities of religious-minority Muslims, Christians and Sikhs. The <strong>architects of the secular and pluralistic concept</strong> of Indian nationhood that sought to embrace this diversity were <strong>Mahatma Gandhi></strong> and <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong>, India’s first prime minister. The Indian National Congress (INC) party that they led has generally followed, if not perfectly, the founders’ philosophy to this day.<br><br>
    However, in recent months a surging wave of <strong>Hindu nationalism</strong> has challenged this bedrock philosophy, touching off a raging national debate about the fundamental nature of India’s political identity. This so-called <strong>intolerance debate</strong>, which has pitted traditional pluralism against a more strident, conservative, religious-based conception of Indian nationhood, has counted among its controversies the February <strong>arrest of doctoral student Kanhaiya Kumar</strong>, a political activist, on charges of <strong>sedition</strong>. The arrest sparked <strong>nationwide protests</strong>, with activists <strong>accusing the BJP of undermining democracy and free speech</strong> by imposing a divisive and heavy-handed brand of right-wing Hindu nationalism.<br><br>
    According to its more hard-line proponents, <strong>Hinduism should supplant secularism</strong> as the guiding principle of Indian society. Taken to its extreme, this would entail the <strong>political and cultural subordination of the country’s Christian and Muslim populations</strong>. While this is unlikely to happen in the near term, even a partial implementation of this vision is cause for concern in a country whose history is punctuated by <strong>gruesome episodes of religious violence</strong> — often between its Hindu majority and Muslim minority. The intensifying clash between the philosophies and the resulting political ramifications will undermine Modi’s already languishing reform agenda and deepen the country’s <strong>political polarization.</strong> <br><br>
    Earlier this year, <strong>Mahua Moitra</strong>, of the opposition <strong>Trinamool Congress Party (TMC)</strong>, said she had seen a list of the <strong>early warning signs of fascism</strong> on a poster in the <strong>Holocaust Memorial </strong> in the US. She read these points in <strong>Parliament</strong> to show that India’s <strong>constitution was under threat</strong> and the country was being “torn apart” by the ruling party’s <strong>“lust to divide”.</strong> She read seven of these points in the Lok Sabha, saying <strong>“India is being pushed to the Dark Ages”.</strong></p>
