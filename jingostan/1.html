    <h1>Powerful and Continuing Nationalism</h1>

    <img  class="yogi1" src="2.png">

    <p><strong>Hindutva</strong> is an ideology first popularised by <strong>Veer Savarkar</strong>, an member of the <strong>Hindu Mahasabha</strong>, in his book titled <strong>“Hindutva”</strong> in 1923. In it he described Hindu as a nation and established the idea of a <strong>Hindu Rashtra</strong>. This rashtra he said was to be <strong>based on Nazi Germany</strong>. Since the rise of the BJP in 2014, <strong>Indian Nationalism</strong> has been fused with <strong>Hindu Nationalism</strong>, their introduction into the mainstream has normalised the fusion of the two. The use of a <strong>saffron flag</strong>, nationalistic songs praising the hindu power of India, slogans like <strong>“Bharat Mata ki Jai”</strong> and the use of the image of <strong>Lord Ram</strong> as the icon for a Hindu India are all furthering the idea of a <strong>Hindu nation.</strong>
